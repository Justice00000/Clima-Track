## Description  
ClimaTrack is a prototype web application that predicts and visualizes the relationship between climate conditions and potential health risks.  
The system combines climate and environmental data with a machine-learning model trained in Python to generate intelligent insights for users and communities.  

This submission represents the **initial MVP** — including the prototype interface screenshots, ML notebook, and a short demo video showing functionality and user flow.
